### Introduction
The goal of this project:
> To predict the sales of the "Food" category from a time-series dataset using the "sales", "onpromotion", and "holiday" variables. <br>

This repository includes the source code and dataset used in the project, as well as a notebook containing all the code, graphs, and explanations using markdown cells and comments within the code. This README file provides a general overview of the project, including the rationale behind the decisions we made. The original dataset and inspiration can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting). <br>

### 1. Motivation & Problem Definition
*Motivation*: <br>
Our team is committed to making a positive impact on the world, and we believe that sustainable development is crucial to achieving this goal. That's why we have chosen to focus on Sustainable Development Goal 12, Responsible Consumption and Production. By promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns, reducing waste and pollution, and improving resource efficiency, we can help create a more sustainable future for all.
To achieve this goal, we have identified a specific problem that we aim to tackle - food wastage by grocery stores. Food wastage is a major issue that has significant economic, social, and environmental implications. Where according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), roughly one-third of all food produced globally is wasted. This leads to unnecessary resource depletion, contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and causes financial losses for businesses. By reducing food wastage, we can reduce the environmental impact of grocery stores, save resources, and support local communities.

*Problem Definition*: <br>
To address this issue, we will leverage the dataset provided by Corporaci√≥n Favorita, one of the largest Ecuadorian-based grocery retailers. By analyzing this data, we aim to identify patterns and trends that can help improve inventory management, reduce waste, and promote more sustainable consumption and production patterns. We believe that by using data-driven insights to drive decision-making in grocery stores, we can create a more efficient and sustainable food supply chain.
