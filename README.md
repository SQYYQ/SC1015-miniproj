### Introduction
The goal of this project:
> To predict the sales of the "Food" category from a time-series dataset using the "sales", "onpromotion", and "holiday" variables. <br>

This repository includes the source code and dataset used in the project, as well as a notebook containing all the code, graphs, and explanations using markdown cells and comments within the code. This README file provides a general overview of the project, including the rationale behind the decisions we made. The original dataset and inspiration can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting). <br>
